<ul class="task-list">
<li>API Changes

<ul class="task-list">
<li>evt.targetNode has changed to evt.target when using event delegation</li>
<li>the native mouse/touch event object is now referenced by the evt key in the Kinetic event object.  i.e., if you want to access the mouse x position relative to the entire page, you would do this: shape.on('mousemove', function(evt) { var mouseX = evt.evt.clientX});</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Features

<ul class="task-list">
<li>new FastLayer for ultra fast rendering.  If you don't need node nesting, mouse and touch interactions, or event pub/sub, you should use FastLayer instead of Layer to create your layers.  It renders about 2x faster than normal layers.</li>
<li>Now passing a Kinetic event object to event handlers which contains a target, type, and evt key that points to the native event object</li>
<li>you can now configure if Kinetic should use degrees or radians via the <code>Kinetic.angleDeg</code> flag.  By default it is true.  You can set it to false if you'd like to use radians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug Fixes

<ul class="task-list">
<li>when users have a browser zoom not equal to 100%, the stage now renders correctly</li>
<li>drag and drop on Android now works much better</li>
<li>Fix memory leak on stage destroy</li>
<li>hasShadow now works correctly after setting shadowEnabled attribute</li>
<li>clone method doesn't clone id attribute</li>
<li>you can clone stage. New container will be automaticaly create, but not added to page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Animations are now much much smoother.  Made several optimizations in the Animation class.</li>
<li>improved mobile drag and drop performance</li>
<li>Now you can change frame rate of sprite during animation</li>
<li>HammerJS support for KineticJS nodes.</li>
<li>Experimental NodeJS support</li>
<li>
<code>isRunning</code> function for <code>Sprite</code>
</li>
<li>optional filter function for <code>getChildren</code> method</li>
<li>add multiple children to container at once: <code>layer.add(rect, circle, group)</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>add</code> works as <code>moveTo</code> if node already has parent container</li>
<li>improved performance of starting and stopping multiple tweens at once</li>
<li>
<code>size</code> method is now overloaded.  You can use it to get or set node sizes</li>
</ul>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>New Features

<ul class="task-list">
<li>all methods are now available with collections.  This means that you can now do things like layer.find('Circle').fill('green'); which will fill all of the circles inside layer with green</li>
<li>all color components now have alpha components as well.  e.g. you can set a fill alpha separately from the stroke using fillAlpha(0.5).</li>
</ul>

<li>Bug Fixes

<ul class="task-list">
<li>fill pattern scale now correctly defaults to 1 instead of 0</li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>API changes

<ul class="task-list">
<li>all rotations are in degrees.  i.e. shape.rotate() is in degrees, not radians.  The shape.rotateDeg() has been deprecated</li>
<li>new overloaded getters and setters.  i.e. setDraggable(true) -&gt; draggable(true) and getDraggable() --&gt; draggable().  The verbose getter and setters are still available, but developers are encouraged to use the overloaded functions.</li>
<li>Line, Spline, Polygon, and Blob have been combined into Line.  A spline is a line with tension.  A polygon is a line with closed=true.  A blob is a line with tension and closed=true.</li>
<li>Sprite animations keys are now an array of numbers, not an array of object literals with x, y, width and height keys.  This drastically cuts down the verbosity of Sprite instantiation</li>
<li>Sprite index attr changed to frameIndex</li>
<li>all multi-dimensional inputs and outputs must be object literals for performance reasons.  i.e. shape.setScale(1) will no longer work.  You need to use shape.setScale({x: 1, y: 1}); </li>
<li>before* events have been deprecated due to performance reasons.  They were causing a performance overhead that isn't really necessary.</li>
<li>the listening attribute can now be set to true, false, or "inherit".  The default is "inherit".  Explicitly setting a node's listening attribute to false will now disable listening, and not behave as an inherit.</li>
<li>the visible attribute can now be set to true, false, or "inherit".  The default is "inherit".  Explicitly setting a node's visible attribute to false will now force the element to be hidden, and not behave as an inherit.</li>
<li>every method that does not return something now returns this</li>
<li>new layer hitGraphEnabled flag allows you to explicitly enable or disable the hit graph in order to improve drawing performance when it's not needed</li>
<li>new node transformsEnabled attr allows you to explicitly enable or disable transforms for a particular node to greatly improve drawing performance.  This is useful if you want your app to perform as fast as possible, and you don't plan on rotating or scaling your shapes, or using nested transforms.  The transformsEnabled attr can be set to "all", "none", or "position"</li>
<li>filters are now set with the filters() method.  The setFilter() method has been deprecated</li>
<li>All filter APIs have changed.  Please see the documentation for new methods.</li>
<li>Node getLevel() method changed to getDepth()</li>
<li>drawFunc() changed to sceneFunc() and drawHitFunc() changed to hitFunc() for consistency.  the draw() method internally uses the sceneFunc function to render the scene graph and the hitFunc function to render the hit graph.  the drawScene() method only uses the sceneFunc function and the drawHit() method only uses the hitFunc function.</li>
<li>the Image createImageHitRegion method has been replaced with the Shape drawHitFromCache() method which works for all shapes, not just images.  In addition to giving us the ability to create more accurate hit regions for images with transparent pixels, it also allows us to create hit regions for filtered shapes.</li>
<li>the color component API has changed a lot.  fillR() has changed to fillRed(), fillB() has changed to fillBlue(), etc.  The same goes for stroke and shadowColor components.  The RGB() methods have been removed because they have muddied up the API.  i.e. fillRGB(), strokeRGB(), and shadowColorRGB() have been removed.  The components are now actual attrs.  the fill attr has priority over components.  i.e. if you set fill to 'blue' but you set the fillRed and fillGreen values, the fill will resolve to blue.</li>
<li>changed dashArray attr to dash</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Features

<ul class="task-list">
<li>New filters.  KineticJS now supports Blur, Brighten, Emboss, Enhance, Grayscale, HSV, Invert, Kaleidoscope, Mask, Noise, Pixelate, Posterize, RGB, Sepia, Solarize, and Threshold</li>
<li>New Arc shape.  Thanks <a href="https://github.com/binoculars">binoculars</a>!</li>
<li>New Ring shape.  Thanks <a href="https://github.com/binoculars">binoculars</a>!</li>
<li>You can now create hit regions for filtered shapes using drawHitFromCache()</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements

<ul class="task-list">
<li>new caching mechanism.  Rather than using toImage() to create an image, and then instantiating a Kinetic.Image shape, you can how just use shape.cache().  You can also use shape.clearCache() to clear the cache.</li>
<li>now anything can be filtered, not just images.  This includes shapes, groups, and even entire layers</li>
<li>multiple filters can now be applied, in any order</li>
<li>Sprite afterFrame() method has been deprecated.  You can achieve the same functionality, with more flexibility, by listening for the index attr change.  i.e. sprite.on('indexChange', function(){...});</li>
<li>Star numPoints attr is defaulted to 5</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>you can now use .get() with multiple selectors, such as layer.get('#myRect, .foo, Text');</li>
<li>further optimized batchDraw logic.  Each layer now has its own instance of a batch draw animation</li>

<li>Filters no longer require a callback.  They are now synchronous.<br>
</li>
<li>Filters now access parameters via getters, such as getFilterBrightness().  This was done to enable filter transitions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New features

<ul class="task-list">
<li>New Skew transform (thanks Daniel Kur and Dave Whipps!)</li>
<li>You can now manipulate individual color components of fill, stroke, and shadowColor, i.e. setFillRGB(), setFillR(), setFillG(), and setFillB(), along with corresponding getter methods.  This also makes it possible to transition colors, and individual color components</li>
<li>new image.clearFilter() method which clears the currently applied filter and returns the image back to its original state</li>
<li>new batchDraw() method which batches redraws together.  Calling batchDraw() multiple times on the same node in between animation frames results in only one redraw per animation frame.</li>
<li>new stage getLayers() method which maps to getChildren()</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Performance Gains

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Increased rendering performance by about 17% by adding matrix transform caching</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements 

<ul class="task-list">
<li>animations can now be tied to a single layer, or an array of layers</li>
<li>All point attrs now have individual component getters and setters. i.e. in addition to setScale() and getScale(), you can now also use setScaleX(), setScaleY(), getScaleX(), and getScaleY()</li>
<li>You can now run multiple independent transitions on a single node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug Fixes

<ul class="task-list">
<li>point getters and setters, such as getScale(), and getOffset(), now return unique default attrs and aren't affected by other node defaults.</li>
</ul>

<li>when using event delegation, the target event property changed from "shape" to "targetNode" for consistency because now any node type can fire events.  i.e. var shape = evt.targetNode</li>
<li>now any node can use the draw() method, not just the stage and layers.  If draw() is used with groups and shapes, the layer is cleared, and just that node is drawn.</li>

<li>dynamic drag and drop layer functionality has been removed.  The performance benefit (very small) did not outweight the complexity that was being introduced into the code base to support it.  Too many edge cases.  High performance drag and drop can still be achieved by intelligently structuring your layers. </li>
<li>removed Collection apply() method to avoid confusion.  For now, just use each()</li>

<p>Note: This release addresses all of the API changes that I've been wanting to make for awhile.  Therefore, it's very likely that you'll need to make changes to your existing application when upgrading.  Significant API changes have been made with Kinetic.Text attrs, shadow attrs, and fill attrs.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>New Features

<ul class="task-list">
<li>new Spline shape</li>
<li>new Blob shape</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements

<ul class="task-list">
<li>big changes to Kinetic.Text shape.  Rectangle component has been removed to simplify the API.  textFill is now fill, textStroke is now stroke, textStrokeWidth is now strokeWidth, and textShadow is now shadow.  If you want to have a rectangle behind the text, you need to group the text with a Kinetic.Rect shape.  Text fontSize units are now in pixels (used to be in points).  The lineHeight attr is now defaulted to 1 (used to be defaulted to 1.2).</li>
<li>drag and drop operations now automatically dynamically create a temporary top layer, and place nodes there for groups and shapes to greatly improve drag and drop performance.  When the drag and drop operation is completed, the layer is removed and the node is placed back into its container</li>
<li>cornerRadius attr moved to rect shape</li>
<li>when dragging and dropping, if the mouse goes outside of the stage, and then returns, the the drag and drop operation is no longer cancelled</li>
<li>shadow object attr has been flattened into shadowColor, shadowBlur, shadowOffset, and shadowOpacity attrs</li>
<li>It's now possible for shapes to extend other shapes</li>
<li>flattened fill attr object.</li>
<li>removed excessive lineDash warnings</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements

<ul class="task-list">
<li>shape draw functions are now passed a Canvas renderer, not a canvas context.  If your application uses custom shapes, please be sure to check out the custom shape tutorial to see what changes will need to be made.</li>
<li>moved dashArray attr to Shape level.  Dash arrays are now rendered using the canvas API setLineDash() method, which enables dashed lines for any type of stroke, not just straight lines.  This was also done in preparation for the new spline feature for the next release.  Since not all browsers support dash arrays at the moment, a warning will be issued when trying to render a dash array in a browser which hasn't implemented it yet</li>
<li>toImage() now accepts x and y params so that you can define the cache rectangle position</li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>New Collections class enables you to apply methods to all of the nodes returned from get().  e.g. <code>stage.get('.foo').apply('setX', 400);</code>.  The Collections class also has a handy <code>each()</code> method for quickly iterating over an array of nodes.  You can also use <code>stage.get('.foo').on('click', '...')</code> (Thanks David Johansson for getting this going!)</li>
<li>new <code>dragBoundFunc</code> property which enables you to define the drag and drop bounds function.  In addition to constraining the drag and drop motion vertically and horizontally, you can also create custom functions that constrain the motion diagonally, radially, or whatever you can come up with.  The <code>dragBoundFunc</code> property has replaced the <code>dragBounds</code> and <code>dragConstraint</code> properties because they are no redundant. (Thanks David Johansson!)</li>

<li>clone() now does a deep copy by also cloning children nodes (Thanks David Johansson!)</li>
<li>when calling layer.show() or hide(), the physical canvas element is shown or hidden rather than drawing or clearing the context.  This greatly improves layer hide and show performance.  (Thanks Adam Wróbel!)</li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>New Features

<ul class="task-list">
<li>new drawBuffer() method which only redraws the buffer canvas</li>
<li>new drawScene() method which only redraws the scene</li>
<li>new getIntersection() method returns an object with shape and pixel data</li>
<li>new createBufferImage() method generates a special image to be drawn on the buffer which enables high precision event detections for images</li>
<li>new clearBufferImage() method clears the buffer image and return to the default buffer rectangle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements

<ul class="task-list">
<li>new hit detection algorithm with complexity of O(1), which means that hit detection performance is constant regardless of the number of shapes.  i.e. you can have tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes, and event detection will still be lightning fast.  <em>Thanks to Ben and the Platfora team for suggesting the color key hash technique!</em>
</li>
<li>Kinetic.Animation is no longer tied to the stage.  You can now create as many animations as you like using new Kinetic.Animation()</li>
<li>drag and drop is now hooked into the animation engine to leverage dynamic frame rates.  This greatly improves performance on mobile devices </li>
<li>There's no longer a distinction between path detection and pixel detection.  The event engine now uses one strategy</li>
<li>removed saveImageData() and clearImageData() methods</li>
<li>alpha property has changed to opacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug Fixes

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Animation last time is now correctly calculated after stopping and restarting an animation</li>
<li>stage.toDataURL() now works correctly with jpg layers (thanks jfollas!)</li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>New Features

<ul class="task-list">
<li>new toImage() method converts any node into an image for the purpose of caching which can greatly improve drawing performance (as much as 4x faster for simple shapes)</li>
<li>new applyFilter() method which enables you to apply filter logic to images (e.g. grayscale, inverting colors, etc.)</li>
<li>on attr change handler event object now contains oldVal and newVal property</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhancements

<ul class="task-list">
<li>toDataURL can now be used synchronously with layers, groups, and shapes. Stage toDataURL() is still asynchronous</li>
<li>saveData() has changed to saveImageData(), and clearData() has changed to clearImageData()</li>
<li>saveImageData() and clearImageData() now work with any node, including the stage, layers, and groups</li>
<li>new on beforeAttrChange event handler which fires immediately before setting an attribute (in contrast to on attrChange, which fires immediately after an attr is updated)</li>
<li>custom shapes draw functions are now passed a context to draw onto.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug Fixes

<ul class="task-list">
<li>getTransform() now takes into account center offset which fixes a bug related to the getAbsoluteTransform method not working correctly when parent nodes had an offset (Thanks Vijai!)</li>
<li>the stage ids and names hashes are now updated correctly whenever a node's id or name changes (thanks Andreas Gerstmayr for getting this started!)</li>
